# Emjinx Example - Basic

This example uses only an HTML form with a POST action to the Emjinx REST API. While this is not the recommended implementation, it can be used as a quick template to get started.

## Setup

In the index.html file, replace the hidden input value with the name EMJINX-API-KEY with your API Key.

## Run

After adding your API Key to the index.html file, open the file in your browser, fill out the from, and press the Submit button.
